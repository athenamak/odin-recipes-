        <h1>Fried Empanadas</h1>
        <p>A popular dish across Latin America, fried empanadas are delcious, savory pastries with a crispy, golden-brown exterior. The dough is folded over a variety of fillings. After being carefully sealed, the empanadas are deep-fried to perfection, resulting in a flaky and crunchy shell that encases the warm, flavorful filling.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>Dough</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>4 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>½ cup shortening</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups water, or as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Filling</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 ½ pounds ground beef</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons paprika</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cumin</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>½ cup raisins</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white vinegar</li>
            <li>2 large hard-cooked eggs, peeled and chopped</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>For Frying</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 quart oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the dough: Stir flour and salt together in a medium bowl. Cut in shortening using a pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>

            <li>Use a fork to stir in water, a few tablespoons at a time, until the mixture comes together.</li>

            <li>Pat into a ball and flatten slightly. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.</li>

            <li>Make the filling while dough is chilling: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and cook until tender, about 5 minutes.</li>

            <li>Add beef, paprika, cumin, pepper, and salt; cook and stir until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>

            <li>Drain excess grease, then stir in the raisins and vinegar. Cover and refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour.</li>

            <li>Remove dough and filling from the refrigerator. Form dough into twenty-four 2-inch balls.</li>

            <li>Stir hard-cooked eggs into filling.</li>

            <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (180 degrees C).</li>

            <li>While the oil is heating, roll one ball dough on a floured surface into a thin circle. Spoon some filling onto the center, fold dough into a half-moon shape, and press the edges with your fingers to seal. Repeat to fill and form remaining empanadas.</li>

            <li>Working in batches, fry 1 to 2 empanadas at a time in hot oil until browned, about 2 1/2 minutes per side.</li>
            
            <li>Drain on paper towels. Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
